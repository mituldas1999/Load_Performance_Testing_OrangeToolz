Dear viewers, 

Iâ€™ve completed performance test on frequently used API for test App. 
Test executed for the below mentioned scenario in server 000.000.000.00. 

800 Concurrent Request with 1 Loop Count; Avg TPS for Total Samples is ~ 77.01 And Total Concurrent API requested: 7928 Error Rate  1.17%.

900 Concurrent Request with 1 Loop Count; Avg TPS for Total Samples is ~ 85.63  And Total Concurrent API requested: 8930 Error Rate  1.2%.

1000 Concurrent Request with 1 Loop Count; Avg TPS for Total Samples is ~ 80.86 And Total Concurrent API requested: 8500 Error Rate  0.76% .

1100 current Request with 1 Loop Count; Avg TPS for Total Samples is ~ 64.69 And Total Concurrent API requested: 10560 Error Rate  10.11%.

1200 Concurrent Request with 1 Loop Count; Avg TPS for Total Samples is ~ 79.15 And Total Concurrent API requested: 6800 Error Rate  11.66% .

While executed 1200 concurrent request, found  1333 request got per 60 sec connection timeout and error rate is 11.66%. 

Summary: Server can handle almost concurrent 9968 API call with almost zero (0) error rate.
